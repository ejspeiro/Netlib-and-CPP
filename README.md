# Netlib-and-CPP

Examples of using the Netlib software in C++11.

These examples are meant to understand how can some Netlib routines be used from
C++11's STL containers.

The routines mainly come from the BLAS and the LAPACK APIs.

I am mainly interested in 3 of the routines... this is because these will be
used in another project of mine... BUT these 3 files should give anyone a
concise look in how to exploit value ordering and the STL, to use the BLAS and
the LAPACK in a way that no wrappers are need, OR to create your own wrappers.

Enjoy!

Eduardo.
