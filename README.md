# Netlib-and-CPP

Examples of using the Netlib software in C++11.

These examples are meant to understand how can some Netlib routines be used from
C++11's STL containers.

The routines mainly come from the BLAS and the LAPACK APIs.

The selection criterion does not matter for now.

Enjoy!

Eduardo.
